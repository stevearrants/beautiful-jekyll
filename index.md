This site showcases my writing experience and tells you more about me. You can view my resume, see some samples of my work, and get to know me a little. My specialties are online and print documentation.

I am a technical writer, editor, and documentation designer with over 30(!) years of experience in the computer software, hardware, and service industries. The simplest way to describe the many things I do is that I build a bridge between people and technology. I help people and organizations meet their goals in the simplest, most effective ways possible.

I’m more than a writer. I’m also an experienced editor and designer. I’m extremely proud of the information I’ve created and the people I’ve helped to develop along the way–and I’m thankful to them as well! I’m very good at taking complex concepts and making them useful and easy to understand. How? Just ask. Let’s have a conversation.

If you need something explained, something complex made simple, let’s talk about how I can create great documentation for your next project. Email me at 

A Microsoft Sway presentation of just what it is I can do for you.
