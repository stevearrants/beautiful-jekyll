This site showcases my writing experience and tells you more about me. You can view my resume, see some samples of my work, and get to know me a little. My specialties are online and print documentation.

I am a technical writer, editor, and documentation designer with over 30(!) years of experience in the computer software, hardware, and service industries. The simplest way to describe the many things I do is that I build a bridge between people and technology. I help people and organizations meet their goals in the simplest, most effective ways possible.

Don&#8217;t think of me as just a writer. I&#8217;m also an experienced editor and editorial manager. I&#8217;m extremely proud of the information I&#8217;ve created and the people I&#8217;ve helped to develop along the way&#8211;and I&#8217;m thankful to them as well! I&#8217;m very good at taking complex concepts and making them useful and easy to understand. How? Just ask. Let&#8217;s have a conversation.

If you need something explained, something complex made simple, let&#8217;s talk about how I can create great documentation for your next project. Call me at **802.735.2189‬** or send an email to **<sarrants@gmail.com>**.

A Microsoft Sway presentation of just what it is I can do for you.
